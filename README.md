 Explored an entirely new domain of applying Machine Learning in collaboration with QUANTUM COMPUTING.

## I tried making two minor projects using QML(Quantum Machine Learning):

**1. Notebook named : Transfer_learning_QCG.ipynb** -> Done binary image classification using **QUANTUM TRANSFER LEARNING.**
     Used two pre-trained models like **Resnet-18, Resnet-34 along with quatum layers** and comapred their val_accuracy.

   **DATASET** -> Used a subset of Hymenoptera dataset which includes images of bees and ants.

   Here, 
   
   **MODEL A** -> Pre-trained Resnet-18/Resnet-34.

   **MODEL B** -> QUANTUM LAYERS.


**2. Notebook named : MNIST_QCG.ipynb** ->  Done MultiClass Image Classification using **Quantum machine learning with the idea of Convolutional Neural Net.** 
Can be called ⏩ **Quanvolutional Neural Network**.

  **DATASET** -> Used subset of MNIST dataset from keras.

In this model, Quantum layers extract features from images and then classical machine learning models are implemented over it.

**Functioning of Quantum layers :-**

a) A small region of the input image, in our example a 2x2 square, is embedded into a quantum circuit. 

b) Quantum computation, associated to a unitary U, is performed on the system. The unitary could be generated by a variational quantum circuit

c) Quantum convolution can be followed by further quantum layers or by classical layers.

**Also, compared the Quantum layered model with Classical Conv net at the end of notebook.**
